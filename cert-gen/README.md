# cert-gen
This code was developed by Neil Buesing in his [kafka-ssl-cluster repo](https://github.com/nbuesing/kafka-ssl-cluster) in the "certificates" directory. 
I've made some modifications to this code for the specific purposes of this library, but the work of setting up this certiifcation/private key generator 
go to Neil.
